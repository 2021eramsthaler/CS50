#Collection of notes in the C language

Scratch: Say (hello, world)

```C
printf("hello, world\n")
```

All printed words are called strings and stringa are enclosed by "string" <br>
\n tells computer to start a newline <br>
The ; is like the period at the end of a sentence. It tells the computer that this is the end of the statement.

Scratch: set counter to 0

```C
int counter = 0;
```

In C, you must declare the type of variable you are creating

Scratch: change counter by 1

```C
counter = counter + 1 # add any number to counter
counter +=1 # add any number to counter
counter++# only adds plus 1 to counter
```

The = sign is not "equals," it means "assign" or "get."
